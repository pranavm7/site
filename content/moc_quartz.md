title: "Quartz MOC"
---

This is the MOC (Maps of Content) for All Things Quartz.

The reason I decided to place the contents here is twofold:

- I personally had an idea to create something similar, and when I came across ![Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) I realized that it fit my needs perfectly!
  - Therefore, I would like to provide a place for you to learn about the framework as well! In order to do the same, I decided it was best that I create this section.
- Another purpose would be to understand how the site functions and how it generates everything from [[/quartz/config|Graph View]] located at the bottom of the website to the simple [[/quartz/hosting|deployment process]] the site has.

I hope you find this useful!

I was always intersted in creating custom social sharing images, especially since the default provided by netlify was not to my liking, I decided to explore my options in creating a solution.

What is a Social Sharing Image?

After googling around, I came across this term mentioned in articles. A social sharing image is the image that is seen (usually) right above a url when you share it on social media platforms such as twitter or facebook to name a few.

Why am I building a solution to this?

Primarily because I want my website to look professional, and one of the many ways to do it is to have a social sharing image for each article on this blog, as when it is shared, people could get a quick glance at what it is about before they even visit!
